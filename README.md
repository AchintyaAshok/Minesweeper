## Minesweeper

Welcome to minesweeper! This is where you can play our online version of minesweeper. To make it more of a challenge (and let's be honest more "fun"), you can challenge your friends to play on the same minesweeper board to beat your score.

### How To Install It
Make sure that you have the `http-server` module installed on your machine:
```bash
npm install -g http-server -o
```

Since we're using the power of node, simply run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
### Running The Game
First, run the http-server module:
```bash
http-server -o
```
Then navigate to <b>/modules/minesweeperApp</b>
